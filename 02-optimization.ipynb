The corners of the simplex is evaluated and according to their values the simplex is either reflected, expanded, contracted or shrunk to find a better value. As a consequence, the simplex starts to move looking for the minimum value, once it finds the minimum it starts to shrink around it. The method normally converges when the size of the simplex is smaller than the expected tolerance.\n",
